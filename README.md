I built a full-stack blog platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). My main purpose for this project is to create a user-friendly space for me to write, edit, and share blog posts. It includes essential features like user authentication, so each I can securely manage my posts with system design. MongoDB is used to store user data and blog content efficiently, while Express.js and Node.js handle the server-side logic, including routing and API requests. On the frontend, React.js ensures a smooth and responsive experience, allowing users to easily navigate, create, and interact with content. The app supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blogs, and comments can be added to encourage interaction between users. This project demonstrates my ability to build a fully functional, responsive, and secure web application, highlighting my skills in both frontend and backend development.
